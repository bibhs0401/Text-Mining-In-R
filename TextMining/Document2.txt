A 13-year-old boy and a 55-year-old man succumbed to burn injuries they sustained while attempting to control a forest fire in Bardabas forest in Gulmi last week. One man sustained critical injuries in the same incident.

In the past 10 days, wildfires have gutted more than 10 houses and sheds in the district, according to the District Police Office. The threat is not over yet as there are several forest fires still active in the district, police said.

Ram Kumar Chaudhary, acting forest officer in Gulmi, said that the forest fires have damaged around 900 hectares of forest land in the district so far this year. Besides human casualties, wildfires have also resulted in the destruction of medicinal herbs worth millions and have also affected the wildlife. “We are still dealing with forest fires and have yet to assess the environmental damage and damage to wildlife,” Chaudhary said.
