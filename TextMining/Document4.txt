Her exploration helped her become a more informed listener, she says. “Digging into Gurung’s work helped me see ‘Kaalpanik’ in a new light,” said the 19-year-old high school graduate. “I was now able to appreciate the song better and understand its nuances.”

Behind every chart-topping hit and iconic album, there is a music producer, one who oversees all aspects of studio production and the creative process—from recording and arrangement to editing, mixing, and mastering. They bring an artist’s vision to life. But despite their critical role in shaping the sound and success of an artist and by turn the industry at large, music producers in Nepal usually go unnoticed and their contribution to the latest hits unrecognised.

Bishal Pradhan, a 28-year-old producer who goes by his pen name ‘Foeseal’, says that Nepal has been late to embrace the very concept of a ‘music producer’, the reason why their contributions are often ignored.
