Every district has a natural disaster management committee and a similar committee in each local unit. These committees have formulated work plans to prevent and control wildfires and mitigate the damage but such plans are rarely implemented.

“The disaster management committee formulates work plans in each local unit,” said Narayan Dev Bhattarai, chief of the Division Forest Office in Palpa. “But they do not invest in equipment needed to prevent and contain forest fires.”
