Seven years after signing of the Trade and Transit Agreement with China that gives Nepal access to seven Chinese ports for third country trade, not a single shipment has moved.

In the wake of a “punitive” Indian blockade after Nepal refused to delay the promulgation of constitution, then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in April, 2016, paid an official visit to China where two sides signed an agreement that gives Nepal access to four Chinese sea ports in Tianjin, Shenzhen, Lianyungang and Zhanjiang, and three land ports in Lanzhou, Lhasa and Shigatse for third-country imports.

The agreement also allowed Nepal to carry out exports through six dedicated transit points between Nepal and China.

The two sides expressed satisfaction on the conclusion of the Agreement on Transit Transport and directed authorities to immediately start negotiation to develop a protocol which will be an integral part of the agreement, according to the text of the agreement signed on April 23, 2016 in Beijing.
